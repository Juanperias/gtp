# GTP (Graph Transfer protocol)

## What is this
Graph Transfer Protocol (GTP) is a protocol designed for the purpose of sending information using graphs (if you don't know what a graph is, I recommend that before reading this specification you look at the [wikipedia page about graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)).

This protocol sends information using Graph Transmission Language (GTL). This language does not take the same syntax as a conventional programming language, later in this document GTL will be explained in detail and comparisons with the rust programming language will be made.

GTP is also passed in UDP and is intended to be sent in udp packets.
